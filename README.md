Perils of generative AI, language models, ML, and DL. 

Sometimes, while we come across ChatGPT like generative AI implementations, such language models, machine learning, etc. I wonder what have we done actually? what have we learned actually? Philosophy - of why, to do or not to do - is lost in a Ph.D. pushed on staple paper-based thesis. As if tracking user activities and behaviour were not enought, new dangerous weapons are being made by enterprises using data.     

These are probable perils of such dangerous models:    

* IP Rights for writers    

* Privacy of individuals    

* Plagiarism, esp in academia and journalism    

* Creativity, originality of thinking and writing - when machines can paint, create music, write acrticles, stories and poems     
  - a soul and experience will be missing in such models    

* Misguided truth that is on the internet or in news    
  - unverified content will be plastered in print and digital media, how commom people will seek truth?    

* Ability to modify how we think    

* Murder of curiosity and inquiry     
  - how curiosity and inquiry for knowledge will survive on campuses?    

* Rational mind, building context, builing systems, troubleshooting skils     

* Ability to change the way we raise our kids or infact we create the future
